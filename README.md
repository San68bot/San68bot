# üëã About Me

**Hello World!ü§ñ** I'm **Sanjay Mohan Kumar** - a Robotics Engineer and Machine Learning Developer currently completing my Master's in Computer Science at George Mason University. I specialize in creating intelligent systems that bridge hardware and AI, from autonomous robotics to AI-powered assistive technologies. My work focuses on practical applications of robotics and machine learning that solve real-world challenges!

**Mission:** *Developing responsive systems that combine algorithmic precision with human-centered design to drive technological progress.*

When not optimizing intelligent robots or training computer vision models, I contribute to open-source projects and mentor FTC teams. 
I believe great engineering balances technical rigor with societal impact!
